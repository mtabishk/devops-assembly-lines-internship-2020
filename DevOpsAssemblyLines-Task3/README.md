## Managing and Deploying Webserver/App using Jenkins and Kubernetes

### Problem Statement:
(Perform the second task of DevOps Assembly Lines) on top of Kubernetes where we use Kubernetes resources like Pods, ReplicaSet, Deployment, PVC and Service.

1. Create container image thatâ€™s has Jenkins installed using Dockerfile Or You can use the Jenkins Server on RHEL 8/7

2. When we launch this image, it should automatically start the Jenkins service in the container.

3. Create a job chain of job1, job2, job3 and job4 using build pipeline plugin in Jenkins 

 Job 1: Pull the Github repo automatically when some developers push the repository to Github.

 Job2: 
   1. By looking at the code or program file, Jenkins should automatically start the respective language interpreter installed image container to deploy code on top of Kubernetes      (   eg. If code is of PHP, then Jenkins should start the container that has PHP already installed )

   2. Expose your pod so that testing team could perform the testing on the pod

   3. Make the data to remain persistent ( If server collects some data like logs, other user information )

Job3 : Test your app if it is working or not.
Job4: if the app is not working, then send email to the developer with error messages and redeploy the application after code is being edited by the developer
